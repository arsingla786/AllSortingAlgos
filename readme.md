##this This repository contains implementations of popular **sorting algorithms** written in **C and C++**. Each algorithm is in its own file with clear logic and comments to help you understand how it works. 

 
 Algorithm         | Language | Description                        |
|------------------|----------|------------------------------------| 
| Bubble Sort       | C        | Repeatedly swaps adjacent elements |
| Selection Sort    | C        | Selects minimum and places it      |
| Insertion Sort    | C        | Inserts elements into sorted part  |
| Merge Sort        | C++      | Divide and conquer algorithm       |
| Quick Sort        | C++      | Picks a pivot and partitions       |
| Heap Sort         | C++      | Uses a binary heap                 |
| Radix Sort        | C++      | Non-comparison integer sort        |
| Counting Sort     | C++      | Counting-based integer sort        |


last three algo will be uploaded shorlty
